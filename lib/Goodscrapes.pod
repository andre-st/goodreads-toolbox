=head1 NAME

Goodscrapes - Simple Goodreads.com scraping helpers (HTML API)


=head1 VERSION

=over

=item * Updated: 2018-08-14

=item * Since: 2014-11-05

=back

=head1 COMPARED TO THE OFFICIAL API

=over

=item * focuses on analysing, not updating info on GR

=item * less limited, e.g., reading shelves and reviews of other members:
        the official API just gets you excerpts(!) of max. 300(!) reviews,
        Goodscrapes can scrape thousands of fulltext reviews.

=item * official is slow too; API users are even second-class citizen

=item * theoretically this library is more likely to break, 
        but Goodreads progresses very very slowly: nothing
        actually broke since 2014 (I started this);
        actually their API seems to change more often than
        their web pages; they can and do disable API functions 
        without being noticed by the majority, but they cannot
        easily disable important webpages that we use too

=item * this library grew with every new usecase and program;
        it retries operations on errors on Goodreads.com,
        which are not seldom (over capacity, exceptions etc);
        it saw a lot of flawed data such as wrong review dates 
        ("Jan 01, 1010"), which broke Time::Piece.

=item * Goodreads "isn't eating its own dog food"
        https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/18536888-is-the-public-api-maintained-at-all#comment_number_1

=back


=head1 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item * slow: version with concurrent AnyEvent::HTTP requests was marginally 
        faster, so I sticked with simpler code; doesn't actually matter
        due to Amazon's and Goodreads' request throttling. You can only
        speed things up significantly with a pool of work-sharing computers 
        and unique IP addresses...

=item * just text pattern matching, no ECMAScript execution and DOM parsing
        (so far sufficient and faster)

=back


=head1 HOW TO USE

=over

=item * for real-world usage examples see Andre's Goodreads Toolbox

=item * C<_> prefix means I<private> function or constant (don't use)

=item * C<ra> prefix means array reference, C<rh> prefix means hash reference

=item * C<on> prefix or C<fn> suffix means function variable

=item * constants are uppercase, functions lowercase
	   
=item * Goodscrapes code in your program is usually recognizable by the
        'g' or 'GOOD' prefix in the function or constant name

=item * common internal abbreviations: 
        pfn = progress function, bfn = book handler function, 
        pag = page number, nam = name, au = author, bk = book, uid = user id,
        bid = book id, aid = author id, rat = rating, tit = title, 
        q   = query string, slf = shelf name, shv = shelves names, 
        t0  = start time of an operation, ret = return code, 
        tmp = temporary helper variable

=head2 Note

        compare as strings

=item * returns a sanitized, valid Goodreads user id or kills 
        the current process with an error message

=back

=head2 C<string> gverifyshelf( I<$name_to_verify> )

        and slows down any analysis

=back

=item * generates and returns a CLI progress indicator function $f, 
        with I<$f-E<gt>( 20 )> adding 20 to the last values and 
        printing the sum like "40 unit_str".
        Given a second argument (the max value), 
        it will print a percentage without any unit: "10%".
        Given a modern terminal, the text remains at the same 
        position if the progress function is called multiple times.

=item * URL for a page with a list of books (not all books)

=item * "&print=true" allows 200 items per page with a single request, 
        which is a huge speed improvement over loading books from the "normal" 
        view with max 20 books per request.
        Showing 100 books in normal view is oddly realized by 5 AJAX requests
        on the Goodreads.com website.

=item * "&per_page" in print-view can be any number if you work with your 
        own shelf, otherwise max 200 if print view; ignored in non-print view

=item * "&view=table" puts I<all> book data in code, although invisible (display=none)

=item * "&sort=rating" is important for `friendrated.pl` with its book limit:
        Some users read 9000+ books and scraping would take forever. 
        We sort lower-rated books to the end and just scrape the first pages:
        Even those with 9000+ books haven't top-rated more than 2700 books.

=item * "&sort=newest" and "&sort=oldest" reduce the number of reviews for 
        some reason (also observable on the Goodreads website), 
        so only use if really needed (&sort=default)
