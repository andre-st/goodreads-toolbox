=head1 NAME

Goodscrapes - Simple Goodreads.com scraping helpers (HTML API)


=head1 VERSION

=over

=item * Updated: 2018-08-12

=item * Since: 2014-11-05

=back

=head1 COMPARED TO THE OFFICIAL API

=over

=item * focuses on analysing, not updating info on GR

=item * less limited, e.g., reading shelves and reviews of other members

=item * official is slow too; API users are even second-class citizen

=item * theoretically this library is more likely to break, 
        but Goodreads progresses very very slowly: nothing
        actually broke since 2014 (I started this);
        actually their API seems to change more often than
        their web pages; they can and do disable API functions 
        without being noticed by the majority, but they cannot
        easily disable important webpages that we use too

=item * this library grew with every new usecase and program;
        it retries operations on errors on Goodreads.com,
        which are not seldom (over capacity, exceptions etc);
        it saw a lot of flawed data such as wrong review dates 
        ("Jan 01, 1010"), which broke Time::Piece.

=item * Goodreads "isn't eating its own dog food"

=back


=head1 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item * slow: version with concurrent AnyEvent::HTTP requests was marginally 
        faster, so I sticked with simpler code; doesn't actually matter
        due to Amazon's and Goodreads' request throttling. You can only
        speed things up significantly with a pool of work-sharing computers 
        and unique IP addresses...

=item * just text pattern matching, no ECMAScript execution and DOM parsing
        (so far sufficient and faster)

=back


=head1 HOW TO USE

=over

=item * for real-world usage examples see Andre's Goodreads Toolbox

=item * C<_> prefix means I<private> function or constant (don't use)

=item * C<ra> prefix means array reference, C<rh> prefix means hash reference

=item * C<on> prefix or C<fn> suffix means function variable

=item * constants are uppercase, functions lowercase
	   
=item * Goodscrapes code in your program is usually recognizable by the
        'g' or 'GOOD' prefix in the function or constant name

=item * common internal abbreviations: 
        pfn = progress function, bfn = book handler function, 
        pag = page number, nam = name, au = author, bk = book, uid = user id,
        bid = book id, aid = author id, rat = rating, tit = title, 
        q   = query string, slf = shelf name, shv = shelves names, 
        t0  = start time of an operation, ret = return code, 
        tmp = temporary helper variable

=head2 Note

=head1 PUBLIC ROUTINES



=head2 C<string> gverifyuser( I<$user_id_to_verify> )

=over

=item * returns a sanitized, valid Goodreads user id or kills 
        the current process with an error message

=back

=head2 C<string> gverifyshelf( I<$name_to_verify> )

=over

=item * returns the given shelf name if valid 

=item * returns a shelf which includes all books if no name given

=item * kills the current process with an error message if name is malformed

=back

=head2 C<$value> _require_arg( I<$name, $value> )

TODO: line of code is useless when died

=head2 C<bool> gisbaduser( I<$user_or_author_id> )

=over

=item * returns true if the given user or author is blacklisted 
        and slows down any analysis

=back

=head2 C<sub> gmeter( I<$unit_str = ''> )

=over

=item * generates a CLI progress indicator function $f, with 
        I<$f-E<gt>( 20 )> adding 20 to the previous value and 
        printing the sum like "40 unit_str".
        Given a second argument with the max value, 
        it will print a percentage.
        in a modern terminal, the text remains at the same 
        position if called multiple times

=back

=head2 C<void> gsetcookie( I<{ content => undef, filepath => '.cookie' }> )

=over

=item * scraping Goodreads.com is a very slow process

=item * scraped documents can be cached if you don't need them "fresh"

=item * during development time

=item * during long running sessions (cheap recovery on crash, power blackout or pauses)

=item * when experimenting with parameters

=item * unit can be C<"minutes">, C<"hours">, C<"days">

=over

=item * loads ratings (no text), reviews (text), "to-read", "added" etc;
        you can filter yourself afterwards

=item * I<rh_into>: C<(id =E<gt> L<%review|"%review">,...)>

=item * optional I<since> argument of type C<Time::Piece>

=item * optional I<on_progress> callback function is called with an
        argument, which contains the number of currently loaded reviews
        (use %5s in format strings)

=item * I<rigor> level 0: search newest reviews only (max 300 reviews)

=item * I<rigor> level 1: search with a combination of filters (max 5400 reviews)

=item * I<rigor> level 2: like 1 plus dict-search if more than 3000 ratings with stall-time of 2 minutes

=item * I<rigor> level n: like 1 plus dict-search with stall-time of n minutes

=item * queries Goodreads.com for the friends and followees list of the given user

=head2 C<string> _shelf_url( I<$user_id, $shelf_name, $page_number = 1> )

=over

=item * URL for a page with a list of books (not all books)

=item * "&print=true" allows 200 items per page with a single request, 
        which is a huge speed improvement over loading books from the "normal" 
        view with max 20 books per request.
        Showing 100 books in normal view is oddly realized by 5 AJAX requests
        on the Goodreads.com website.

=item * "&per_page" in print-view can be any number if you work with your 
        own shelf, otherwise max 200 if print view; ignored in non-print view

=item * "&view=table" puts I<all> book data in code, although invisible (display=none)

=item * "&sort=rating" is important for `friendrated.pl` with its book limit:
        Some users read 9000+ books and scraping would take forever. 
        We sort lower-rated books to the end and just scrape the first pages:
        Even those with 9000+ books haven't top-rated more than 2700 books.

=item * "&shelf" supports intersection "shelf1%2Cshelf2" (comma)

=item * "&sort=newest" and "&sort=oldest" reduce the number of reviews for 
        some reason (also observable on the Goodreads website), 
        so only use if really needed (&sort=default)

=item * "&search_text=example", max 30 hits, invalidates sort order argument
